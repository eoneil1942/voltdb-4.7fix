% Examples Guide

Example Projects
================
The following projects are included in the examples directory:

json
  This example shows how to use flexible schema and JSON within
  a VoltDB application.

voltcache
  This example shows memcache-like cache implemented using VoltDB.

voltkv
  This directory contains the sources for the "Key-Value" implementation
  in VoltDB.

voter
  This example is a simulation of a telephone based voting process
  where callers are allowed a limited number of votes.

windowing
  This example shows an application that takes in time-series data, runs analytic
  queries over several time-windows, and deletes older data as it either ages out or
  passes a rowcount threshold.

Typing "./run.sh help" will show the available targets for each example.
The targets "client" and "server" let you run a client and server for each example.

To run an example project, 'cd' to that example's directory and:
- In a terminal window, run "./run.sh" (no target) to compile the Java and start the VoltDB server
- In a separate terminal window, run "./run.sh client", where you will see the results
- When complete, hit Ctrl C in the server terminal window to stop the VoltDB database

See the README file in each example directory for more details.
